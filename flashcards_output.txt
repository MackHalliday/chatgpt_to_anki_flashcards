What is Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)?;Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is used for storing data persistently in AWS. It can be used as the root (boot) volume for EC2 instances or as additional storage for applications and data.
Can EBS volumes be detached from one EC2 instance and attached to another?;Yes, EBS volumes can be detached from one EC2 instance and attached to another, providing flexibility in managing storage.
What is the Delete on Termination attribute for EBS?;By default, the root EBS volume is deleted when the attached EC2 instance terminates, while any other attached EBS volumes are not deleted.
What is an EBS snapshot?;An EBS snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume. It can be used to recreate the volume and is often used for backup and disaster recovery purposes.
What are the types of EBS volumes?;The types of EBS volumes are: General Purpose (gp2 and gp3), Provisioned IOPS (io1 and io2), Throughput Optimized (st1), and Cold HDD (sc1).
What is the multi-attached feature of EBS?;The multi-attached feature allows the same EBS volume to be attached to multiple EC2 instances in the same availability zone. This is only available for the io1/io2 family of EBS volumes.
What is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)?;An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured virtual machine image that contains the necessary information to launch an EC2 instance. It includes an operating system, application server, applications, and additional configurations.
What are the ways to launch an EC2 instance from an AMI?;An EC2 instance can be launched from a public AMI provided by AWS, your own custom AMI, or an AMI available in the AWS Marketplace.
What is EC2 Instance Store?;EC2 Instance Store provides high-performance, hardware-based disk storage for EC2 instances. It offers better I/O performance but the storage is lost if the instance is stopped or terminated.
What is EFS (Elastic File System)?;EFS is an AWS service that provides scalable and highly available file storage. It can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances and is suitable for use cases such as content management, web serving, and data sharing.
What are the performance modes for EFS?;The performance modes for EFS are General Purpose (default) and Max I/O. General Purpose is suitable for most workloads, while Max I/O is optimized for high-performance workloads.
What are the storage classes available in EFS?;The storage classes available in EFS are Standard, Infrequent Access (EFS-IA), and Archive. Standard is for frequently accessed files, EFS-IA is for infrequently accessed files with lower retrieval costs, and Archive is for files accessed a few times each year.
